In this program, I figured that it would kind of be fun to make a webapp so I figured that this would be a good opportunity to try making one.

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.} I decided to make a task manager app, and in order to access it I had to access my files through the command prompt and to start it I had to type npm start once it started I was able to do as the app was built for and I was able to add tasks and delete them.

I figured that it would be a simple project to do, I've never used react before so I figured that it would be something that I could use in order to break the ice on building a web app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
